# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to explore, analyze and visualize ridesharing data in order to understand ridership and fare metrics by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural).  Analysis of the data is designed to help PyBer CEO V. Isualize and other stakeholders make decisions about which types of cities need more driver support, and which city types are generating the most income.

## Results  

By reviewing the summary we can see that there are several key findings:  
- Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.

- Urban cities have the highest ride demand while rural cities have the least

- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver

- The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides

## Summary
Based on the analysis, my business recommendations to Pyber are: 
- Ensuring there are enough drivers in rural areas to meet ride demand; higher fares may indicate longer trips given the geographical area; given the small amount of drivers, revenue opportunity may be lost.
- Urban cities have the highest total fare and most amount of rides and therefore account for most of the revenue for the company. More investments should be continued to be made in this type to realize greater profits for PyBer in the future. 
- The suburban city type is the middle performing city type in all the metrics calculated, therefore more investments can be invested in the other two city types (urban and rural), as this city type can continue to perform as it is doing currently for PyBer.
